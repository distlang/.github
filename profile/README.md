# **Welcome to Dist**

**Dist** is a high-performance framework for **distributed data management and processing**, featuring its own Domain Specific Language (DSL). Designed for environments where data is processed across distributed networks, **Dist** enables powerful data handling capabilities, whether you're working on individual devices or across large-scale distributed systems. Its clean and simple syntax is tailored for **real-time data streaming**, **batch processing**, and complex **data aggregation**, making it an ideal tool for **AI-driven** and **data workflows**.

## **Key Features of Dist**:

- **Custom Scripting Language**: Dist's built-in DSL allows users to perform flexible data operations without needing to know more complex programming languages, making it accessible to data analysts, scientists, and business users.
- **High-Performance C++ Core**: While the DSL provides ease of use, Dist's C++ foundation gives it top-tier performance for demanding data processing tasks.
- **Distributed Data Processing**: Manage and process data across a network of interconnected devices, with support for both local and distributed computing environments.
- **Real-Time Data Streaming**: Ingest and process data in real-time, applying the same operations as batch data processing.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Built-in support for complex analytical functions like time series analysis, clustering, PCA, and random forest classification.
- **Memory-Efficient Processing**: Optimized for handling large datasets with limited memory using advanced data structures and Apache Arrow integration.
- **Multi-Format Support**: Work with various data formats including CSV, JSON, and Parquet.
- **AI Workflow Integration**: Preprocess and prepare data for seamless integration with AI models for training or inference.
- **Data Provenance and Transparency**: Track data transformations and workflows for compliance and accountability.

## **Why Dist?**

Dist bridges the gap between high-performance distributed computing and user-friendly data analysis. It offers:

- **Accessibility**: The custom DSL allows users to leverage Dist's power without the need for more complex programming languages.
- **Scalability**: Effortlessly transition from local processing to large-scale distributed systems.
- **Flexibility**: Combine real-time and batch processing in a single, unified environment.
- **Performance**: Utilize the C++ core for computationally intensive tasks while maintaining ease of use.
- **AI-Ready**: Seamlessly prepare and process data for AI and machine learning workflows.

## **Getting Started with Dist**
